# Malware For Alex - Malware4Alex dataset repository

## In this repository is the code for generating the dataset Malware4Alex as well as the dataset.

The dataset is created by running a python script on an AWS container.

The script consists on a  web crawler which download executables into a VM, hashes them using md5 and calls the api VirusTotal to get all existing information on the executable, then if the required 56 labels are in the call the script appends it to Malware4Alex.csv

Next once the target number of executables is achived, in this case 100k, the file cleanData.py imports all the CSV data, pre-process it, cleans it, weights it, fixes its mean and imports it to wherever its main function is called.

Below is a diagram of how the system works.
